On this day, Roody decided that he would take \(wordInputs[0]) on a \(wordInputs[2]) and magical adventure to find the elusive \(wordInputs[3]) that lived in the \(wordInputs[4]). Upon entering the \(wordInputs[4]), Roody became overcome with fear of the \(wordInputs[5]) \(wordInputs[3]). The \(wordInputs[3]) had a staggering \(wordInputs[6]) eyes, \(wordInputs[7]) rows of teeth, and \(wordInputs[8]) tails. Obviously, the \(wordInputs[3]) was no match for either Roody or \(wordInputs[0]), so they both died from \(wordInputs[9]) as a result of just looking at the \(wordInputs[3])."
